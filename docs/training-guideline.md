# Training Guide
This section goes over the most important metrics and settings to achieve a balanced generator/discriminator adversarial training, where both models converge and learn from each other.


## Best Practices
It is recommended to use the training warmups and schedulers as explained above. The following images present how these rpactices are reflected in the logs.

### Objectives and loss composition

The generator and discriminator are optimised with a weighted sum of reconstruction, perceptual, and adversarial criteria so you can balance spectral fidelity against perceptual sharpness:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \lambda_{\text{L1}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{L1}} + \lambda_{\text{perc}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{perc}} + \lambda_{\text{adv}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}} + \lambda_{\text{SAM}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{SAM}} + \lambda_{\text{TV}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{TV}}.
$$
Each coefficient maps directly to the `Training.Losses` block in the configuration file, mirroring the weighted-sum description from the paper. Typical setups emphasise pixel/L1 and perceptual terms early on, then ramp in adversarial weight to sharpen textures once the discriminator has warmed up.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

For smoother validation curves and more stable inference, the trainer can maintain an exponential moving average of the generator parameters. After each optimisation step, the EMA weights $\theta_{\text{EMA}}$ are updated toward the current generator state $\theta$:
$$
\theta_{\text{EMA}}^{(t)} = \beta \, \theta_{\text{EMA}}^{(t-1)} + (1 - \beta)\, \theta^{(t)},
$$
where the decay $\beta \in [0,1)$ controls how much history is retained. During validation and inference, the EMA snapshot replaces the live weights so that predictions are less sensitive to short-term oscillations. The final super-resolved output therefore comes from the smoothed generator,
$$
\hat{y}_{\text{SR}} = G(x; \theta_{\text{EMA}}),
$$
which empirically reduces adversarial artefacts and improves perceptual consistency.


#### Generator LR Warmup
When starting to train, the learning rate slowly raises from 0 to the indicated value. This prevents exploding gradients after a random initialization of the weights when training the model from scratch. The length of the LR warmup is defined with the `Schedulers.g_warmup_steps` parameter in the config. Wether the increase is linear or more smooth is defined with the `Schedulers.g_warmup_type` setting, ideally this should be set to `cosine`.

#### Generator Pre-training
After the loss stabilizes, the generator continues to be trained while the discriminator sits idle. This prevents the discriminator form overpowering the generator in early stages of the training, where the generator output is easily identifyable as synthetic. The binary flag `training/pretrain_phase` is logged to indicate wether the model is still in pretraining or not. Wether the pretraining is enabled or not is defined with the `Training.pretrain_g_only` parameter in the config, the parameter `Training.g_pretrain_steps` defines how many steps this pretraining takes in total. The parameter `Training.g_warmup_steps` decides how many training steps (batches) this smooth LR increase takes, setting it to `0` turns it off.

#### Discriminator 
Once the `training/pretrain_phase` flag is `0`, pretraining of the generator is no longer active and the discriminator starts to be trained. Not only is it trained, but its true/false prediction is also added to the generator to start the adversarial *game*. To avoid training the generator on low-quality discriminator outputs at this early stage, we gradually feed the discriminator output to the generator as a loss. For that, we slowly increase the adversarial loss weight from `0` to the predetermined amount. The loss weight is logged to WandB in order to visualize the influence this loss has on the generator.

#### Continued Training
As training continues, the generator is trying to fool the discriminator and the discriminator is trying to distinguish between true/synthetic, we monitor the overall loss of the models independantly. When the overall loss metric of one model reaches a plateau, we reduce it's learning rate in order to optimnally train the model.
![lr_scheduler](assets/lr_scheduler.png). The patience, LR decrease factor inc ase of plateau and the metric to be used for these LR schedulers are all defined individually for $G$ and $D$ in the `Schedulers.` section of the config file.

The schedulers now expose a `cooldown` period and `min_lr` floor. Cooldown waits a configurable number of epochs before watching for the next plateau, preventing back-to-back reductions, while `min_lr` guarantees that the optimiser never stalls at zero. Use these knobs to keep the momentum of long trainings without overshooting into vanishing updates.

#### TTUR, Adam defaults and gradient clipping

Both optimisers use a two-time-scale update rule (TTUR) so the discriminator defaults to a slower learning rate than the generator. The bundled Adam configuration mirrors popular GAN recipes with betas set to `(0.0, 0.99)` and `eps=1e-7`, ensuring the generator reacts quickly to discriminator feedback without building up stale momentum. Weight decay is automatically restricted to convolutional and dense kernels—normalisation layers and biases are excluded—so regularisation never interferes with running statistics. Finally, `gradient_clip_val` applies global norm clipping when set above zero; values between `0.5` and `1.0` work well when discriminator spikes cause unstable updates.

#### ESRGAN checkerboard mitigation (10m defaults)

If you observe faint checkerboard textures, especially in flat/low-frequency areas, start with:
- `Generator.use_icnr: True` to initialise PixelShuffle pre-convolutions with ICNR.
- `Optimizers.optim_d_lr <= 0.5 * optim_g_lr` to keep discriminator pressure in check.
- `Training.Losses.fixed_idx: [0, 1, 2]` for 4-band inputs so VGG perceptual loss uses RGB consistently.

#### Final stages of the Training
With further progression of the training, it is important not only to monitor the absolute reconstruction quality of the generator, but also to keep an eye on the balance between the generator and discriminator. Ideally, we try to reach the Nash equilibrium, where the discriminator can not distinguish between real and synthetic anymore, meaning the super-resolution is (at least fdor the discriminator) indistinguishable from the real high-resolution image. This equilibrium is achieved when both $D(y)$ and $D(G(x))$ approach `0.5`.
