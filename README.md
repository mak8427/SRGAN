# 🌍 Single Image Super-Resolution Remote Sensing 'SRGAN'

**Remote-Sensing-SRGAN** is a research-grade GAN framework for **super-resolution of Sentinel-2 and other remote-sensing imagery**. It supports arbitrary band counts, configurable generator/discriminator designs, scalable depth/width, and a modular loss system designed for stable GAN training on EO data. Check out how inference and training works right now in this interactove example!

## 📖 Documentation

Full docs live at **[srgan.opensr.eu](https://srgan.opensr.eu/)**. They cover usage, configuration, training recipes, and deployment tips in depth.

## 🧠 Highlights

* **Flexible models:** swap between SRResNet, RCAB, RRDB, LKA, ESRGAN, and stochastic generators with YAML-only changes.
* **Remote-sensing aware losses:** combine spectral, perceptual, and adversarial objectives with tunable weights.
* **Stable training loop:** generator pretraining, adversarial ramp-ups, EMA, and multi-GPU Lightning support out of the box.
* **PyPI distribution:** `pip install opensr-srgan` for ready-to-use presets or custom configs.
* **Extensive Logging:** Logging all important information automatically to `WandB` for optimal insights.

---

## 🏗️ Configuration Examples

All key knobs are exposed via YAML in the `opensr_srgan/configs` folder:

* **Model**: `in_channels`, `n_channels`, `n_blocks`, `scale`, ESRGAN knobs (`growth_channels`, `res_scale`, `out_channels`), `block_type ∈ {SRResNet, res, rcab, rrdb, lka}`
* **Losses**: `l1_weight`, `sam_weight`, `perceptual_weight`, `tv_weight`, `adv_loss_beta`
* **Training**: `pretrain_g_only`, `g_pretrain_steps`, `adv_loss_ramp_steps`, `label_smoothing`, generator LR warmup (`Schedulers.g_warmup_steps`, `Schedulers.g_warmup_type`), discriminator cadence controls
* **Data**: band order, normalization stats, crop sizes, augmentations

---

## 🎚️ Training Stabilization Strategies

* **G‑only pretraining:** Train with content/perceptual losses while the adversarial term is held at zero during the first `g_pretrain_steps`.
* **Adversarial ramp‑up:** Increase the BCE adversarial weight **linearly** or smoothly (**cosine**) over `adv_loss_ramp_steps` until it reaches `adv_loss_beta`.
* **Generator LR warmup:** Ramp the generator optimiser with a **cosine** or **linear** schedule for the first 1–5k steps via `Schedulers.g_warmup_steps`/`g_warmup_type` before switching to plateau-based reductions.
* **EMA smoothing:** Enable `Training.EMA.enabled` to keep a shadow copy of the generator. Decay values in the 0.995–0.9999 range balance responsiveness with stability and are swapped in automatically for validation/inference.

The schedule and ramp make training **easier, safer, and more reproducible**.

## ⚙️ Config‑driven components

| Component | Options | Config keys |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Generators** | `SRResNet`, `res`, `rcab`, `rrdb`, `lka`, `esrgan`, `stochastic_gan` | `Generator.model_type`, depth via `Generator.n_blocks`, width via `Generator.n_channels`, kernels/scale plus ESRGAN-specific `growth_channels`, `res_scale`, `out_channels`. |
| **Discriminators** | `standard` SRGAN CNN, `patchgan`, `esrgan` | `Discriminator.model_type`, granularity with `Discriminator.n_blocks`, ESRGAN-specific `base_channels`, `linear_size`. |
| **Content losses** | L1, Spectral Angle Mapper, VGG19/LPIPS perceptual metrics, Total Variation | Weighted by `Training.Losses.*` (e.g. `l1_weight`, `sam_weight`, `perceptual_weight`, `perceptual_metric`, `tv_weight`). |
| **Adversarial loss** | BCE‑with‑logits on real/fake logits | Warmup via `Training.pretrain_g_only`, ramped by `adv_loss_ramp_steps`, capped at `adv_loss_beta`, optional label smoothing. |

The YAML keeps the SRGAN flexible: swap architectures or rebalance perceptual vs. spectral fidelity without touching the code.

## 🧑‍🚀 Authors, Acknowledgements, and Notes on AI Usage

Developed within the **ESA Φ-lab / OpenSR** initiative. Simon Donike is the main contributor and maintainer of the repository. Cesar Aybar and Julio Contreras contributed the datasets as well as implementation, documentation and publishing support. Prof. Luis Gómez-Chova contributed the remote sensing-spefific perspective and signal processing advice.  
> The development history of this code began in 2020 with the implementation of an SR-GAN for a MSc thesis project. Since then, over several iterations, the codebase has been expanded and many training tweaks implemented, based on the experiences made training SR-GANs for the OpenSR project. The fundamental training outline, training tweaks, normalizations, and inference procedures are built upon that experience.  
The added complexity that came with (a) the implementation of many different models and blocks, (b) more data sources, (c) according normalizations, and (d) complex testing and documentation structures, was handled to varying degrees with the help of *Codex*. Specifically, the docs, the automated testing workflows, and the normalizer class are in part AI generated. This code and its funcitonalities have been rigorously verified and tested to the best of my ability.
