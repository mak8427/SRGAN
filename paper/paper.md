# Summary

We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote-sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference.
By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.


# Introduction

Optical satellite imagery plays a key role in monitoring the Earth's surface for applications such as agriculture [@agriculture], land cover mapping [@mapping], ecosystem assessment [@ecosysetm], and disaster management [@disaster]. The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 mission provides freely available multispectral imagery at 10 m spatial resolution with a revisit time of five days, enabling dense temporal monitoring at global scale. In contrast, very-high-resolution sensors, such as Pleiades or SPOT, offer much richer spatial detail but limited temporal coverage and high acquisition costs. Consequently, a trade-off exists between spatial and temporal resolution in Earth-Observation (EO) imagery.

Single-image super-resolution (SISR) aims to enhance the spatial detail of low-resolution (LR) observations by learning a mapping to a plausible high-resolution (HR) counterpart.  
In remote sensing, SR can bridge the gap between freely available medium-resolution imagery and costly commercial data, potentially improving downstream tasks such as land-cover classification, object detection, and change detection.  
The advent of deep convolutional networks led to major breakthroughs in both reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism [@dong2015imagesuperresolutionusingdeep; @kim2016deeplyrecursiveconvolutionalnetworkimage].

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [@goodfellow2014generativeadversarialnetworks] introduced an adversarial learning framework in which a generator and a discriminator are trained in competition, enabling the synthesis of realistic, high-frequency image details. Since their introduction, GANs have been rapidly adopted in the remote-sensing community for tasks such as cloud removal, image translation, domain adaptation, and data synthesis [@11159252; @su2024intriguingpropertycounterfactualexplanation].  
These applications demonstrated the potential of adversarial training to generate spatially coherent and perceptually plausible remote-sensing imagery.

Building on these successes, the computer-vision community introduced the Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN) [@ledig2017photo], which combined perceptual and adversarial losses to reconstruct photo-realistic high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts. The approach inspired a wave of research applying SRGAN-like architectures to remote-sensing super-resolution [@rs15205062; @9787539; @10375518; @satlassuperres], where the ability to recover fine spatial detail from coarse observations can significantly enhance analysis of land cover, infrastructure, and environmental change.

Recent advances in diffusion and transformer-based architectures have shifted the state of the art in image super-resolution toward generative models with stronger probabilistic and contextual reasoning [@s1; @s2; @s3].  
Nevertheless, GAN-based approaches continue to be actively explored [@g1] and remain a practical choice for operational production settings [@allen].

# Statement of Need

Despite their success in computer vision, GANs remain notoriously difficult to train [@p1; @p2; @p3]. The simultaneous optimization of generator and discriminator networks often leads to unstable dynamics, mode collapse, and high sensitivity to hyperparameters. In remote-sensing applications, these issues are amplified by domain-specific challenges such as multispectral or hyperspectral inputs, high dynamic range reflectance values, varying sensor characteristics, and limited availability of perfectly aligned high-resolution ground-truth data. Moreover, researchers in remote sensing rarely work with fixed RGB imagery. They frequently need to adapt existing GAN architectures to support arbitrary numbers of spectral bands, retrain models for different satellite sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2, SPOT, Pleiades, PlanetScope), or implement benchmarks for newly collected datasets. These modifications usually require non-trivial changes to the model architecture, preprocessing pipeline, and loss configuration, making reproducibility and experimentation cumbersome. Implementing the full set of heuristics that make GAN training stable, such as generator pretraining, adversarial loss ramping, label smoothing, learning-rate warmup, and exponential moving-average (EMA) tracking, adds another layer of complexity. Consequently, reproducing and extending GAN-based SR models in the Earth-Observation (EO) domain is often time-consuming, fragile, and inconsistent across studies.



# Contribution Summary

OpenSR-SRGAN was developed to address these challenges by providing a unified, modular, and extensible framework for training and evaluating GAN-based super-resolution models in remote sensing. The software integrates multiple state-of-the-art SR architectures, loss functions, and training strategies within a configuration-driven design that allows users to flexibly adapt experiments without modifying the source code.

The main contributions of this work include:

- **Modular GAN framework:** Supports interchangeable generator and discriminator architectures with customizable depth, width, and scale factors.  
- **Configuration-first workflow:** Enables fully reproducible training and evaluation through concise YAML files, independent of code changes.  
- **Training stabilization techniques:** Includes generator pretraining, adversarial ramp-up, learning-rate warmup, label smoothing, and EMA smoothing.  
- **Multispectral compatibility:** Provides native support for arbitrary band configurations from different satellite sensors.  
- **OpenSR ecosystem integration:** Connects seamlessly to the SEN2NAIP dataset, leverages the unified evaluation framework `opensr-test` [@osrtest], and supports scalable inference via `opensr-utils` [@osrutils].

Together, these features make OpenSR-SRGAN a reliable boilerplate for researchers and practitioners to train, benchmark, and deploy GAN-based SR models across diverse Earth-observation datasets and sensor types.

# Software Overview and Framework Design

OpenSR-SRGAN follows a modular and configuration-driven architecture. All model definitions, loss compositions, and training schedules are controlled through a single YAML configuration file, ensuring that experiments remain reproducible and easily adaptable to new sensors, band configurations, or datasets. The framework is implemented in PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, providing seamless GPU acceleration and built-in experiment logging.  

The system consists of four main components:  

- A flexible **generator–discriminator architecture** supporting multiple SR backbones.  
- A configurable **multi-loss system** combining pixel, perceptual, spectral, and adversarial objectives.  
- A robust **training pipeline** with pretraining, warmup, ramp-up, and EMA stabilization mechanisms.  
- Integration with the **OpenSR ecosystem** for dataset access, evaluation (`opensr-test`), and large-scale inference (`opensr-utils`).  

## Generator Architectures

The generator network can be configured with different backbone types, each offering a different balance between complexity, receptive field, and textural detail.

The `Generator` class provides a unified implementation of SR backbones that share a common convolutional structure while differing in their internal residual block design.
The module is initialized with a `model_type` flag selecting one of `res`, `rcab`, `rrdb`, `lka`, `esrgan`, `cgan`, each drawn from a shared registry of block factories or dedicated ESRGAN implementation.
Given an input tensor $x$, the model applies a wide receptive-field head convolution, followed by $N$ residual blocks of the selected type, a tail convolution for residual fusion, and an upsampling module that increases spatial resolution by a factor of 2, 4, or 8.  
The network ends with a linear output head producing the super-resolved image:
$$
x' = \mathrm{Upsample}\!\left( \mathrm{Conv}_{\text{tail}}\!\left(\mathrm{Body}(x_{\text{head}}) + x_{\text{head}}\right)\! \right).
$$

This modular structure allows researchers to experiment with different block designs, standard residual, channel attention (RCAB), dense residual (RRDB), large-kernel attention (LKA), or noise-augmented variants, without altering the training pipeline or configuration schema. All models share identical input-output interfaces and residual scaling for stability, ensuring drop-in interchangeability across experiments.


## Discriminator Architectures

The discriminator can be selected to prioritize either global consistency or fine local realism. The different discriminator variants are designed to capture different aspects of realism, from global structure to fine-grained texture. Three discriminator variants are implemented to complement the different generator types: a global `Discriminator`, a local `PatchGANDiscriminator`, and the deeper `ESRGANDiscriminator`. All are built from shared convolutional blocks with LeakyReLU activations and instance normalization.

The standard discriminator follows the original SRGAN [@ledig2017photo] design and evaluates the realism of the entire super-resolved image and the actual HR image. It stacks a sequence of strided convolutional layers with progressively increasing feature channels, an adaptive average pooling layer to a fixed spatial size, and two fully connected layers producing a scalar real/fake score. This 'global' discriminator promotes coherent large-scale structure and overall photorealism.

The `PatchGANDiscriminator` instead outputs a grid of patch-level predictions, classifying each overlapping region as real or fake. Built upon the CycleGAN/pix2pix [@cyclegan; @px2px] reference implementation, it uses a configurable number of convolutional layers and normalization schemes (batch, instance, or none). The resulting patch map acts as a spatial realism prior, emphasizing texture fidelity and fine detail.

The `ESRGANDiscriminator` mirrors the deeper VGG-style stack from ESRGAN. Its `base_channels` and fully connected `linear_size` can be tuned to match the generator capacity, offering an aggressive adversarial signal when paired with RRDB-based generators.

Together, these architectures allow users to select the appropriate adversarial granularity: global consistency through SRGAN-style discrimination, local realism through PatchGAN, or sharper perceptual contrast via ESRGAN.

Finally, all discriminator variants optionally support spectral normalization, a weight-normalisation technique that stabilises GAN training by constraining the Lipschitz constant of each layer. When enabled, the convolutional and linear layers in the discriminator are wrapped with a spectral-normalisation operator that estimates their dominant singular value, preventing overly sharp or oscillatory discriminator behaviour. This stabilisation mechanism follows the formulation of [@miyato]. Spectral normalization is activated directly from the configuration file and is compatible with all discriminator types (Global, PatchGAN, ESRGAN-style).

# Training Features

Training stability is improved through several built-in mechanisms that address the common pitfalls of adversarial optimization. These are configured in the `Training` section of the YAML `config` file.

## General Training Optimizations
Several additional methods contribute to stable adversarial optimization. Label smoothing replaces hard discriminator targets (1 for real, 0 for fake) with softened values such as 0.9 and 0.1, preventing overconfidence and promoting smoother gradients. A short generator warmup phase allows $G$ to learn basic low-frequency structure before adversarial feedback is introduced, often combined with a linear or cosine learning-rate ramp to avoid abrupt updates. The discriminator holdback delays $D$ updates for the first few epochs so that $G$ can stabilise; when enabled, $D$ also follows a short warmup schedule to balance learning rates. Finally, both optimisers employ adaptive scheduling via `ReduceLROnPlateau`, lowering the learning rate when progress stagnates. These implementations mitigate divergence and improve convergence stability in adversarial training. All of these techniques can be configured from the `config` file as the unified entry-point.

## Wasserstein GAN
When the adversarial mode is set to Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), the discriminator is reinterpreted as a critic, producing unbounded real-valued scores rather than probabilities. In this formulation, the losses become:

$$
\mathcal{L}_D = \mathbb{E}[D(\hat{y})] - \mathbb{E}[D(y)]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\mathcal{L}_G = -\,\mathbb{E}[D(\hat{y})].
$$

This removes the need for a sigmoid activation and mitigates the vanishing-gradient issues typical of Jensen–Shannon GANs, following the Wasserstein GAN formulation of Arjovsky et al. (2017) [@arjovsky2017wasserstein]. Instead of weight clipping, OpenSR-SRGAN can be configured to use the R1 gradient penalty, which regularises the critic by penalising the squared gradient of the real-data scores [@mescheder2018r1]:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{R1}} = \frac{\gamma}{2}\,\mathbb{E}\big[\lVert \nabla_y D(y) \rVert^2\big].
$$

This promotes smooth critic behaviour near the real data manifold, substantially improving stability in multispectral settings. The WGAN+R1 setup integrates seamlessly with the existing training features—generator warmup, label smoothing, EMA, and LR ramping—while offering a more robust adversarial objective.

## Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Stabilisation

The EMA mechanism [@ema] is an optional stabilisation technique applied to the generator weights to produce smoother outputs and more reliable validation metrics, commonly used throughout model training pipelines in general and generative image applications in particular. Instead of evaluating the generator using its raw, rapidly fluctuating parameters, an auxiliary set of duplicate weights $\theta_{\text{EMA}}$ is maintained as a smoothed version of the online weights $\theta$. After each training step, the model parameters are updated as an exponential moving average:
$$
\theta_{\text{EMA}}^{(t)} = \beta \, \theta_{\text{EMA}}^{(t-1)} + (1 - \beta)\, \theta^{(t)}
$$
where $\beta \in [0,1)$ is the decay factor controlling how much past states influence the smoothed estimate.  
A higher $\beta$ (e.g., 0.999) gives longer memory and stronger smoothing, while a lower value responds more quickly to new updates.  

During validation and inference, the EMA parameters replace the instantaneous generator weights, yielding more temporally consistent reconstructions and reducing the variance of perceptual and adversarial loss curves.  
The inference process thus evaluates:
$$
\hat{y}_{\text{SR}} = G(x; \theta_{\text{EMA}})
$$
where $\hat{y}_{\text{SR}}$ denotes the final super-resolved output produced by the EMA-stabilised generator. Empirically, applying EMA has been shown to stabilise adversarial training by mitigating oscillations between the generator and discriminator and by improving the perceptual smoothness and reproducibility of the resulting super-resolved images [@ema2].

## Loss Functions

Each loss term can be weighted independently, allowing users to balance spectral accuracy and perceptual realism. Typical configurations combine L1, Perceptual, and Adversarial losses, optionally augmented by SAM and TV for multispectral consistency and smoothness. The overall objective is a weighted sum of these terms defined in the `Training.Losses ` section of the configuration. The framework also logs a comprehensive set of training and validation metrics alongside these losses.

In addition to classical adversarial, pixel, and perceptual losses, the framework supports a Wasserstein adversarial loss with optional R1 gradient penalty. When enabled, the adversarial component is replaced by the Wasserstein critic objective, while an auxiliary R1 term is added to the discriminator loss to enforce smoothness and stabilise training. This mode is especially effective for multispectral SR tasks where standard GAN losses may struggle with high-dynamic-range reflectance distributions.


# Limitations
Super-resolution techniques, including those implemented in OpenSR-SRGAN, can enhance apparent spatial detail but can never substitute for true high-resolution observations acquired by native sensors. While OpenSR-SRGAN provides a stable and extensible foundation for GAN-based super-resolution in remote sensing, several limitations remain. First, the framework focuses on the engineering and reproducibility aspects of model development rather than achieving state-of-the-art quantitative performance. It is therefore intended as a research and benchmarking blueprint, not as an optimized production model. Second, although the modular configuration system greatly simplifies experimentation, users are still responsible for ensuring proper data preprocessing, radiometric normalization, and accurate LR–HR alignment, factors that strongly influence training stability and reconstruction quality. Third, adversarial optimization in multispectral domains remains sensitive to dataset size and diversity; small or unbalanced datasets may still yield mode collapse or spectral inconsistencies despite the provided stabilization mechanisms. Finally, the current release does not include native uncertainty estimation or automatic hyperparameter tuning; these remain open areas for future extension.
